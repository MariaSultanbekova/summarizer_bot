# Hi thereðŸ˜‰

Do you also have friends who like to send long voice messages??
So today we will do one thing that will make our life much easier if we don't have a cup of tea and a couple of free minutes at hand


The task that we will solve is called summarization. Summarization is the generalization of a text in one or more sentences.

There are 2 types:
- abstractive(generate one sentence that contains the whole essence of the text)
- exctractive(choosing the most important sentences from the text)

In implementation, the second one is easier, so let's start with it




## The approach is called tf-idf, and is to measure the importance of each word for the document.

"If a word occurs frequently in this document and rarely in others, then it is really important."
