# Hi thereðŸ˜‰

Do you also have friends who like to send long voice messages??
So today we will do one thing that will make our life much easier if we don't have a cup of tea and a couple of free minutes at hand


The task that we will solve is called summarization. Summarization is the generalization of a text in one or more sentences.

There are 2 types:
- abstractive(generate one sentence that contains the whole essence of the text)
- exctractive(choosing the most important sentences from the text)

The second approach is better in our case, so we will use it.
